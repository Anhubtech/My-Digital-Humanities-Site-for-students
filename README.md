okay, my site is still in progress but you can see the final version soon...

Hi there!
Here is my site about data visualization in Digital Humanities for bachelor students.
Data visualization plays an essential role in representing data so that its underlying patterns might be conveyed and understood. This site contains an introduction workshops to data visualization with online services for visualization and data visualization with matplotlib, popular plotting librarie in Python.
The first part of this workshops will showcase various ways that online services can be used for creating graphics, following which weâ€™ll dive into matplotlib Python librarie.
